## Data source

The data to be analyzed is information from seasons 1-14 of the US series of the reality TV show *Shark Tank*^[CITATION], a show where entrepreneurs pitch their emerging businesses to a panel of investors called *sharks*. This dataset includes information about the entrepreneurs, their businesses, and their deals with the sharks. 

## Why this data

In investigating this data, I intend to find if there are differences between the investment and pitching trends of female and male entrepreneurs and sharks. Outside of reality TV, female entrepreneurs tend to face greater barriers and often have their businesses undervalued. Industries typically thought to be female-dominated or feminine are often less respected. In this dataset, I specifically aim to investigate if female entrepreneurs receive investment as often as male entrepreneurs, if that investment aligns with their initial demands, which sharks invest in female entrepreneurs more often, and if specific sharks undervalue businesses started by women compared to men.
